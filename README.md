Asteroid Collision Predictor
This project aims to predict whether an asteroid is on a collision course with Earth by building predictive models using machine learning and statistical techniques.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information on possible asteroid impacts with Earth and characteristics of known near-Earth asteroids. You can download the dataset here.

Key Tasks
Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset's structure, identify relevant attributes for prediction.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, and outliers.
Model Building: Develop predictive models (e.g., machine learning, statistical) for estimating impact likelihood.
Model Optimization: Fine-tune hyperparameters, prevent overfitting or underfitting.
Validation and Testing: Validate model performance using appropriate techniques, test on unseen data.
Presentation: Prepare a compelling presentation summarizing the problem, data, approach, and results.
