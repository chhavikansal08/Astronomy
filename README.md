# Asteroid Collision Predictor

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting potential collisions between asteroids and Earth. It achieves this by leveraging machine learning and statistical techniques to build predictive models.

## Dataset

The dataset utilized in this project contains valuable information about potential asteroid impacts with Earth and various characteristics of known near-Earth asteroids. Access the dataset [here](orbit.csv).

## Key Tasks

### 1. Data Exploration

- Analyze the structure of the dataset to identify pertinent attributes for prediction.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality.

### 3. Model Building

- Utilize machine learning and statistical methods to construct predictive models for estimating the likelihood of impact.

### 4. Model Optimization

- Fine-tune model hyperparameters to enhance performance and prevent overfitting or underfitting.

### 5. Validation and Testing

- Validate model performance using appropriate techniques and test on unseen data to ensure robustness.

### 6. Presentation

- Create an engaging presentation summarizing the problem statement, dataset specifics, the chosen approach/methodology, and the obtained results.
